        This document provides a historical over view of how web applications
        have started to be integrated into native application environments, and
        outlines the use cases and requirements for a standard that could allow
        users to "install" web applications. The use cases and requirements
        were gathered by examining the landscape of proprietary solutions, and,
        where possible, by gathering statistics about the prevalence and usage
        patterns of particular solutions used in the wild. Proprietary
        solutions that integrate web applications into the underlying operating
        system have been used in the wild for a few years now, so consolidation
        towards a standardized solution could potentially benefit users,
        developers, and browser vendors.

        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p>
        To launch native applications on either a desktop-class machine or a
        mobile device, users are generally presented with icons and
        corresponding labels that represent the applications installed on their
        system. Having the icons of web applications appear amongst
        applications that the user considers native (e.g., those on the home
        screen of a device) gives the perception to users that a web
        application has been "installed" - even if the processes that go into
        actually "installing" a web application differ from those of a native
        application.

          Mavericks.

      </figure>
      <p>
        At the time of writing, the web platform lacks a standardized means for
        a web application to indicate that it can be "installed" and treated as
        if it were an native application. As this document will show, the web
        platform also lacks sufficient metadata for a Web application to be
        successfully integrated into an operating system in the same way native
        applications are (i.e., not just on the homescreen, but integration
        into other contexts such as the task switcher, privacy and security
        settings, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this gap in the web platform, browser vendors, including
        Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, have implemented proprietary
        solutions that allow users to add web applications to the homescreen.
        To achieve this integration, developers use proprietary opt-in
        mechanisms, which we will discuss later, to indicate to the browser
        that the web application can potentially work as a stand-alone
        application once it's added to the homescreen. These opt-in mechanisms
        also provide metadata (e.g., the icons and name of the application)
        that allows web browsers to add a web application to the homescreen so
        to appear indistinguishable from an application that is natively
        installed.

      <h2>
        From bookmarks to installed web apps
      </h2>
      <p>
        To access a web application, users traditionally opened up a web
        browser, typed a URL or a search query into a search box, and had the
        browser navigate to the web application they wanted. Alternatively, a
        user may have "bookmarked" within a Web browser a set of web documents
        or web applications they commonly access.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, browsers have started to monitor user's browsing habits
        to intelligently deduce which are the most common web sites the user
        likes to visit (i.e., a type of automatic bookmarking). The browser
        will then present visual links to those sites. Depending on the
        browser, user-defined and automatically-gleaned bookmarks will appear
        as a list of document titles or file names in either a drop-down menu,
        "speed-dial" cells, a toolbar, and/or a dedicated application window or
        tab. All these bookmark types are illustrated below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/desktop_bookmarking.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
          <p>
            There are at least six different ways to access bookmarks in a
            desktop-based browser. Some of those bookmarks are derived
            dynamically by monitoring user's browsing habits, such as the most
            visited sites and "speed dial" entries the user sees when they open
            a new tab.
          </p>

        <h3>
          Bookmarking on mobile browsers
        </h3>
        <p>
          On mobile devices, the interaction model has traditionally been the
          same as the one described above: there has historically been a clear
          distinction between opening a native application and accessing a Web
          application. That is, the user needs to first locate the Web browser
          they want to use, launch it, and then either type-in a URL or use a
          bookmark to access a Web application. Web browsers that run on mobile
          operating systems have thus had to add similar bookmarking facilities
          as those found in desktop-class browsers, as shown below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/mobile_bookmarks.jpg" alt=
          "From left to right, the bookmarking facilities of Safari on iOS, Android 4.3 stock browser, Chrome on iOS, and Firefox OS's default browser.">
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              The bookmarking facilities of mobile browsers closely resemble
              those of desktop-browsers - providing both a traditional list of
              bookmarks as well as a "speed dial" that can contain either
              automatically gleaned bookmarks or user-configured ones.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Having bookmarking facilities in mobile browsers helps reduce some of
          the burden associated with having to type URLs. Particularly for
          sites that the user visits regularly, it means that a web site can be
          accessed by a single press. Additionally, bookmarking facilities help
          separate locally installed applications from web sites the user needs
          to access for other reasons (e.g., a particular wiki page on an
          intranet, a document with commonly used information, etc.).
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Limitations of bookmarking: multiple home screens
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because bookmarks contain links to a range of different types of
          resources, the bookmarking facilities of desktop and mobile browsers
          do not integrate into an operating system's application menu. This
          means that web applications and "native" applications are treated as
          different things. This separation makes sense for many kinds of web
          sites (e.g., static, informational ones that provide little other
          functionality), but there is a range of applications that can provide
          an experience that is analogous to that provided by an application
          installed locally on a user's device (e.g., a game, an office
          productivity suite, a news or social networking site, a currency
          converter or photo manipulation utility, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown below, this desire to treat websites as applications has led
          at least one browser maker to attempt to replicate the homescreen
          experience directly in the browser itself.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/ios_default_tab.png" alt=""> <img src=
          "images/iOS_homescreen.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>
            In iOS 7's Safari web browser, the default tab view presents icons
            derived from websites to create what is, in effect, a second
            homescreen - image on the left. This can be clearly seen when
            contrasted with the actual iOS 7 homescreen -image on the right.
            Google Chrome's browser, although not shown here, does the same
            thing in iOS: it presents bookmarked pages as a grid of icons.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Although this is a convenient way to access web sites, there are web
          applications that would benefit users if they could be directly
          available from the primary home screen. Also relegating web
          applications to this second homescreen means that web applications
          are treated as "second-class citizens": in the sense that in order to
          access these applications, a user must first launch the correct
          browser (from potentially a range of different browsers), and then
          press the icon for the application they wish to load.

      <h2>
        Add to homescreen
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ideally, web applications should be immediately available to users,
        without them needing to launch a separate application (a web browser)
        and having to type a URL. And application may be found through browsing
        the web (e.g., through a search engine or through a website that works
        as an "app store"), but once "installed", it should be functionally
        indistinguishable from a native application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browser makers have long acknowledged this as something users would
        want: iOS's Safari has had the capability to add a website to the
        homescreen since early 2008 (as of version 1.1.3, as shown in the
        figure below); the Android's stock browser has provided the capability
        to "add to homescreen" since at least 2009 - though the process of
        adding to website to the homescreen was significantly more convoluted.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/early_addtohomescreen.jpg" alt="iOS 1.1.3">
        <figcaption>
          iOS's Safari has almost always provided a way for users to add
          websites to the home screen of the device. Once the use presses
          "add", the icon for the Web application is placed along side other
          native application icons.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The ability to add a web site to the homescreen didn't automatically
        make a web application look, feel, or integrate into the operating
        system in the same way as native applications did. For instance,
        originally in iOS, launching a web application that had been added to
        the homescreen took the user back into Safari. It was only with the
        release of iOS 2.2 in September 2008 that applications that had been
        added to the home screen gained the capability to be displayed full
        screen (doing away with Safari's application chrome, shown below).

          A side-by-side comparison of a web application running in Safari next

          the right, browser chrome, including the navigation buttons, ability
          to bookmark, and the URL and search bar, have all been removed.

        <h3>
          From fancy bookmark to installed webapp
        </h3>
        <p>
          What initially started as a way to simply add a link to a website
          from iOS's homescreen has incrementally evolved to diminish the
          functional differences between a web application and a native
          application. This has not happened on the OS level alone: progress on
          the web platform, such as the ability to make content available
          off-line, performance gains through hardware acceleration, and
          integration with native form controls, has assisted in diminishing
          these differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, tighter integration between web applications and the
          underlying operating system has meant that applications that are
          added to the homescreen behave differently to those accessed directly
          through a web browser. There are also areas where native applications
          remain distinct, by having capabilities that are not accessible to
          installed web applications.

        <h3>
          Key components of the installed application experience
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order for a web application to be "installed" in such a way that
          it provides a user experience that is indistinguishable from that of
          a native application, a number of key things are needed:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            Name(s):
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The ability for a user to find an application through its name(s).
            Some OSs allow native applications to be found by using multiple
            names. Web applications, because of HTML's origin as a
            document-publishing format, have a "title" and these titles are
            applied "per page" basis using HTML's &lt;title&gt; element.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Icons:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The graphical representations that represent the application in
            various contexts (primarily, an icon that functions as an
            application's unique identifier amongst a list of installed
            applications), but also in other contexts - such as settings
            screen. Because of the various contexts that a native application's
            icon can appear in an OS, native applications typically need to
            provide a large range of icons at different sizes and, more
            recently, specifically targeted at different device pixel
            densities.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Orientation:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Applications, such as games, require that they be started in a
            particular orientation to function effectively. Web applications
            are generally designed using responsive web design techniques,
            which means [???]

        When users add a web application to the home screen and the web

        the figure below, this makes the distinction between a native
        application and a web application negligible from an OS-integration
        perspective.

      <h2>
        Names
      </h2>
      <p>
        Native applications can have multiple names. Because of this, you can
        find them in multiple ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Web applications get their names from the &lt;title&gt;. This is
        annoying. It means constantly having to fix the name when you add to
        home screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML5 provides a soluton, "application-name":
      </p>
      <pre class="highlight">
    ddd
    
</pre>
      <p>
        HTML5 limits this to 1 name:
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The value must be a short free-form string giving the name of the Web
          application that the page represents. If the page is not a Web
          application, the application-name metadata name must not be used.
          There must not be more than one meta element with its name attribute
          set to the value application-name per document. User agents may use
          the application name in UI in preference to the page's title, since
          the title might include status messages and the like relevant to the
          status of the page at a particular moment in time instead of just
          being the name of the application.

        Security and privacy
      </h2>
      <p>
        The act of adding an application to the home screen serves as a cue to
        alter the security policy of an application. For example, in iOS, and
        application that has been added to the home screen will no longer share
        cookies, localStorage, IDB, etc. with the Safari Web browser. The OS
        will also reset all its API permissions, so, for example, any
        previously granted permission to access location services that occured
        in the browser are forgotten once the application is added to the
        homescreen - the end-user willneed to re-enable such permission again
        after the application is launched from the homescreen.

      <p>
        Furthermore, by adding the application to the home screen, the
        application gains its own independent privacy settings in iOS's privacy
        menus. This is shown in the figure below.

          services for the Web browser does not affect the ability of Forecast
          to access location services.

        A user can add a web application to the home screen from anywhere
        within a website (e.g., while reading a document). Returning to that
        same document when the applicaiton starts back up might not be ideally
        what either the user or developer want.
